## 📌 Features

- 📊 **Prevalence Calculator**  
  Computes the proportion of individuals in a population who have a specific disease at a given time.

- 📈 **Incidence Rate Calculator**  
  Measures the rate of new cases in a population during a defined time period.

- 🔁 **Relative Risk (RR) Calculator**  
  Compares the probability of an event occurring between exposed and unexposed groups.

- 🎯 **Odds Ratio (OR) Calculator**  
  Evaluates the strength of association between exposure and outcome in case-control studies.

Each calculator:
- Displays the **formula** used.
- Shows the **working** (calculation steps).
- Presents the **final result** with interpretation.
- Provides **error handling** for invalid inputs.

📚 Example

Relative Risk Calculation

If:

Exposed with disease = 50

Exposed without disease = 150

Unexposed with disease = 20

Unexposed without disease = 180


The app calculates:

Incidence in exposed group

Incidence in unexposed group

RR = Ie / Iu

Final interpretation: whether the exposure increases or reduces risk
